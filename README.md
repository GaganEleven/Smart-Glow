# Smart-LED-Lamp
The project aims to develop a smart LED lighting system, which is remotely controlled by Android apps via handheld devices, e.g., smartphones, tablets, and so forth. A color pallet is shown on the app from which the user can select a color combination to be emitted by LED Bulb. Arduino Uno is used as Backend device to control the LED.

So what do you need for this Project:

Hardware: 
1. Arduino Uno Atmega or any other similar microcontroller.
2. Some Jumper Wires Male to Female & Male to Male.
3. Bread Board.
4. RGB LEDs having 4 pins.
5. ESP8266-01 Wifi Module.
6. Wifi Enabled Android Smartphone.

Software:
1. Android Studio.
2. Arduino IDE.
3. ESP Download Tool (Attached).
4. ESP AT Firmare (Attached).

Knowledge: 
1. Android Studio and Java Programming.
2. Arduino Ide and little bit knowledge of C/C++.

To get started follow these steps:
1. Open ESP8266 folder and follow the README.md on that folder to flash firmware to ESP.
2. Open Arduino folder and follow the README.md on that folder to upload program to arduino.
3. Open Android folder and follow the README.md on that folder to install android application to the android smartphone.

There you go, Happy Programming! Good Luck with Arduino and Esp.
